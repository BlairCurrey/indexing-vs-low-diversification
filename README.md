In some investment circles you often here adages like "You can't beat the market" or statistics such as "90% of professional fund managers don't beat the market" ([which is actually false](https://www.barrons.com/articles/if-you-still-own-actively-managed-stock-funds-get-ready-for-some-bad-news-51579691701))
in support of the idea of just buying index funds. For whatever it's worth, I like index funds too. But these seem like hasty conclusions. Warren Buffet has famously
asserted that "diverisification is a protection against ignorance," and he has a point - if you *know* a company is a great value why not bet big?

My goal is not to find such companies or even argue against diverisification. Instead, I want to see how likely beating the market is if someone bets on one company. 
I don't mean finding the next Apple or Amazon, but simply betting on established, well-known companies. In support of this, I will look at the DIA, a fund that 
tracks the Dow Jones, and it's components to see what portion of these outperformed the index as a whole.
